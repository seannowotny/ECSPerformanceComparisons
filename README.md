# ECS Performance Comparisons

This Unity project is dedicated to comparing data-oriented design and various Entity Component System (ECS) libraries in the context of rapid prototyping.

The implementations emphasize simplicity and productivity over highly optimized, boilerplate heavy solutions.

Rendering systems are currently GameObject-based and slow, but can be disabled by pressing the space bar.

## Currently Included Showcase Scenes

- DOD (inspired by [Combat Bee Benchmarks](https://github.com/maskrosen/combat-bees-benchmarks))
- DefaultECS
- Arch
- Unity ECS

## This project is looking for contributors!

It would be awesome if **ECS Performance Comparisons** could make a more fair and comprehensive comparison between different data-oriented game development approaches in the future.

Take a look at our [issues page](https://github.com/seannowotny/EcsPerformanceComparisons/issues) if you would like to participate in working towards this goal!
