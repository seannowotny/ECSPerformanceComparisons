# ECS Performance Comparisons

Project to compare data-oriented design and various ECS libraries.

Inspired by the [Combat Bee Benchmarks](https://github.com/maskrosen/combat-bees-benchmarks).

Comparisons between different ECS libraries favour simplicity and productivity over boilerplate heavy, multithreaded solutions. This project sacrifices runtime performance in favour of elegance.

Rendering system performance isn't of concern. The rendering systems can be disabled by pressing the space bar.
